Everything is still a work in progress and we appreciate any positive feedback that we can get :]

Nothing special to review in guiComponents project. 

In the data project, the project class and database class could be reviewed; Our project class calls other smaller object classes such
as projFinances, projTime, projItems. 

In the guiMain project, the version class, ImportExportHelper class, and DIYProjectMain class are ready for review. The other class in the
project is still a work in progress and will be essentially rebuilt over the weekend.
